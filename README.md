# Doggie Database

This project is a React application developed with TypeScript, utilizing Vite as the build tool. It showcases a gallery of dog breeds, allowing users to view different breeds and their images. The application uses `ky` for making API calls to fetch data dynamically, and `Zod` for validating API responses to ensure robust error handling and data integrity.

## Features

- **List Dog Breeds**: View a list of dog breeds.
- **View Breed Images**: Click on a breed to see more images of that specific breed.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: UI library for building the interface.
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Vite**: Frontend tooling for faster and leaner development builds.
- **Zod**: TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference.
- **ky**: Lightweight and simple HTTP client based on the Fetch API.
